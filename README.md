# Housing_Data_cleaning

This is a data cleaning project presented by Alex the Analyst on Youtube using SQL. 
The data is on Nashville homes sold between 2013 and 2016. 
Through the project I standardized the date format, split addresses into seperate columns, fixed nulls, deleted duplicates, and removed unnecessary columns.
